Known Issues
============
$Id$

PHP < 5.1.3:
	HttpResponse::getHeader() does not work with Apache2 SAPIs.
	Using an encoding stream filter on a stream you read from doesn't work.

Windows:
	If you keep getting "SSL connect error" when trying to issue 
		requests, try another (newer) libeay32.dll/ssleay32.dll pair.

Internals:
	Our http_urlencode_hash() does not differentiate between prefixes
		for numeric or string keys.
	Inflating raw deflated data causes a re-initialization of the inflate
		stream where the corresponding window bits are modified to tell libz
		to not check for zlib header bytes.  This is not preventable AFAICS.
