Known Issues
============
$Id$

HttpResponse (only in PHP-5.1+):
	HttpResponse::getHeader() does not work in Apache2 with a 
PHP version lower than 5.1.3 (as mod_php).

Windows:
	If you keep getting "SSL connect error" when trying to issue 
requests, try another (newer) libeay32.dll/ssleay32.dll pair.

Deflate/Inflate:
	Inflating raw deflated data causes a re-initialization of the inflate
stream where the corresponding window bits are modified to tell libz to 
not check for zlib header bytes.  This is not preventable AFAICS.
	Using an encoding stream filter on a stream you read from, will
not work as expected in a PHP version lower than 5.1.3.

Internals:
	-	our http_urlencode_hash() does not differentiate between prefixes
		for numeric or string keys.
