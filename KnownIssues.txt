HttpResponse class is only available for PHP >= 5.1

HttpResponse::guessContentType() is not available on Windows at the time this
was written, unless you compile PHP or ext/http yourself[1]. Additionally
you'll need to fix the magic.mime file that's shipped with PHP by executing
`sed -e "s/\t!/\\\!/" magic.mime > magic.good` and then of course use the new 
magic file.
