HttpResponse class is only available for PHP >= 5.1

HttpResponse::getHeader() does not work in Apache2 with a PHP version
lower than 5.1.3 (as mod_php).

If you keep getting "SSL connect error" when trying to issue requests on
Windows, try another (newer) libeay32.dll/ssleay32.dll pair.

Deflate/Inflate:
	http_inflate() resp. the HttpInflateStream should be able to inflate
any compressed data (gzip, deflate AKA zlib and raw deflate).  However,
inflating raw deflated data causes a re-initialization of the inflate
stream where the corresponding window bits are modified to tell libz
to not check for zlib header bytes.  This is not preventable AFAICS.
	http_deflate() resp. the HttpDeflateStream should be able to
generate any compressed data (gzip, deflate AKA zlib and raw deflate);
just use the flag for the data format you want to generate:
	HTTP_DEFLATE_TYPE_GZIP, HTTP_DEFLATE_TYPE_ZLIB or HTTP_DEFLATE_TYPE_RAW.

Internals:
	-	there's a memleak with sizeof(zval) for each thrown exception, 
		which ends up in HttpRequestPoolExcepiont::$exceptionStack, in 
		HttpRequestPool::__construct(); it doesn't happen with wrapped
		exceptions in HttpRequestPool::send().

	-	our http_urlencode_hash() only handles arrays and does not
		differentiate between prefixes for numeric or string keys.
