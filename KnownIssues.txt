$Id$

HttpResponse class is only available for PHP >= 5.1

HttpResponse::guessContentType() is not available on Windows at the time this
was written.  On other platforms you'll need to fix the magic.mime file that's
shipped with PHP by executing `sed -e "s/\t!/\\\!/" magic.mime > magic.good`
and using the new magic file.
